Project for Team-Project-2022 class

# The goal of the project
 1. Implement two different neural networks. A fully connected MLP and a spiking fully connected MLP.
 2. Train each of them to predict one, two or three bits out of the AES cipher and analyze the behaviors as well as the results

    In order to simplify task, work will not be done on the full AES algorithm but on one of its components, the Rijndael Mix Column algorithm.
